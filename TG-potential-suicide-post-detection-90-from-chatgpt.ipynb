Cohen's Kappa of 0.78. \nLesson: ChatGPT hallucinates with conflicting inputs, better results via more specific focus, and prompt design matters. Three minor adjustments were tried, and the result below is consistent for what I've been able to prompt from ChatGPT 3.5 (exact model name is in the code below). \nBoth agree on potential suicide post =  541 times.\nBoth agree on not suicide post =  1068 times.\nGround truth says potential suicide post and LLM disagrees =  118 times.\nGround truth says not a suicide post and LLM disagrees =  58 times.\nCalculated Observed Agreement = 0.9014005602240897\nCalculated Chance Agreement = 0.5430178345848143\nCohen's Kappa= 0.7842378822676176\n\nReading https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25773-2 (Identifying Suicide Ideation and Suicidal Attempts in a Psychiatric Clinical Research Database using Natural Language Processing)\n\"The sets were independently classified by all three authors with good inter-rater agreement as indicated by a Cohen’s kappa of 0.85 for suicide ideation and 0.86 for suicide attempt. (See supplementary material for further details on inter-rater agreement and rules: https://github.com/andreafernandes/NLP_Tools_Development). It seems that 86% agreement may be in a gold standard range. I also took a few cues and updated the prompts.\n\nAdded a Cohen Kappa calculation with further optimization of the prompts and loops:\nBoth agree on potential suicide post =  459 times.\nBoth agree on not suicide post =  1100 times.\nGround truth says potential suicide post and LLM disagrees =  200 times.\nGround truth says not a suicide post and LLM disagrees =  26 times.\nCalculated Observed Agreement = 0.8733893557422969\nCalculated Chance Agreement = 0.5597266357523402\nCohen's Kappa= 0.7124271996920467 (this is mid range for generally accepted significant agreement)\n\nThere were a total of 226 errors made relative to ground truth.\nAccuracy is at 87.3389355742297 %\n\nThe obserer agreement looks good, and Kappa is generally also a good result, even if a bit\nbelow the gold standard of the article above. For those not familiar with Cohen's Kappa:https://www.statology.org/cohens-kappa-statistic/\n\nI am not sure where an algorithm might be overfitting, but I'm pretty sure a generalized solution\ncan only be a little more accurate without being unusually too accurate relative to human on human comparisons and those human on human should be the most generalized comparisons.\n\nExperiment: Loaded 80% of the tweets for similarity matches in a stratified way made only a small change in accuracy with the main difference in the false negatives. Experiments:\n1. Originally with the LLM deciding on potential suicide posts alone was 82.5% accuracy\n2. With 80% stratified in the vectorstore the potential suicide post achieved 83.6% accuracy\n3. Loading 80% of the tweets with potential suicide post status shows 84.6% accuracy\n4. A prompt improvement aimed at considering depression and becoming tired of life shows 87.3% accuracy\n5. Updated the prompts to aim at improvements after reading (Identifying Suicide Ideation and Suicidal Attempts in a Psychiatric Clinical Research Database using Natural Language Processing)\n\nThe OpenAI ChatGPT LLM heavily seems to favor the probability of saying a large number of ground\ntruth cases for potential suicide posts are not suicide posts (shown as false negatives against the ground truth) even when the vector store is indexed with many of the actual data points providing similarity matches for being potential suicide posts.\n\nThe prompts were improved, the output made easier to read when confirming the LLMs performance and\nthe number of retries needed when the LLM produces unusable results. Also, the results are now \nprocessed to make sure outputs are valid responses, and exceptoins on dictionary processing are\nhandled (keys are found).\n\n## 1 Use pip to install langchain and Chroma\n## 2 Load and prepare a dataset for ChatGPT to work upon\n## 3 Ask ChatGPT to analyze batches of 4 tweets for suicide related ideation\n## 4 Report False Positives, False Negatives, and overall accuracy (with listing)\n## 5 Report Cohen's Kappa\n## 6 Load a VectorstoreIndex with all the tweets to ask inter-tweet questions\n## 7 Show a few (3) questions and the answers given\n\nYou will need to use your own OpenAI API key or change to a 'no cost' LLM.\nHope this proves useful to some viewer. A full run of this notebook, using\ndefault setting with ChatGPT 3.5, cost about 0.40 USD per OpenAI's usage information.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment
